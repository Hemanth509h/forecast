Project Title Developing a Predictive Model to Forecast Sales Using Historical Data Project Structure The project is organized into two clearly separated modules to ensure scalability and maintainability: project/ │ ├── frontend/ → React JS (User Interface only) └── backend/ → Python (Data Science & Machine Learning) Technology Stack Used Frontend React JS Used only for: User interface Sales input forms Displaying predictions Charts and visualizations Node.js is used only for React build tools (npm) Node.js is NOT used for backend logic Backend Python ONLY No Node.js backend is used Python is responsible for: Data preprocessing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Feature engineering Machine learning model training Sales prediction REST API creation using Flask or FastAPI Communication Between Frontend and Backend Frontend and backend communicate using REST APIs React frontend sends requests to Python backend Python API processes the request and returns predictions in JSON format Data Flow: User → React UI → Python REST API → ML Model → Prediction → React UI Problem Overview Small businesses rely heavily on accurate sales forecasting for inventory management, staffing, budgeting, and profitability. However, many businesses still depend on assumptions or manual estimation instead of data-driven insights. This project addresses this problem by using historical sales data collected from Kaggle and applying Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict future sales. The system is implemented using a Python-only backend and a React-based frontend, without using Node.js for backend processing. Data Source Dataset collected from Kaggle Kaggle provides real-world historical sales datasets The dataset includes: Date and time of sales Sales quantity or revenue Pricing details Promotional or seasonal indicators (if available) Objective of the Project The main objectives of this project are to: Collect historical sales data from Kaggle Analyze past sales patterns and trends Perform data cleaning and preprocessing Apply feature engineering techniques Build multiple predictive models using Python Compare different machine learning algorithms Select the most accurate sales forecasting model Deploy the model as a Python-based REST API Connect the React frontend to the Python backend for real-time predictions Why This Problem Is Important Prevents over-stocking and under-stocking Improves inventory and financial planning Encourages data-driven decision-making Reduces business risks Increases profitability and operational efficiency Helps small businesses compete with data-driven enterprises Approaches Used 1. Regression Models Example: Linear Regression Used to identify trends and relationships in sales data Simple and interpretable baseline model 2. Decision Tree Models Rule-based decision-making approach Handles non-linear relationships Easy to understand and visualize 3. Ensemble Methods Combine multiple models to improve accuracy Examples: Random Forest Gradient Boosting Reduce overfitting and improve generalization 4. Time Series Forecasting Models Designed specifically for time-dependent sales data Capture trend, seasonality, and cyclic patterns Examples: ARIMA / SARIMA Prophet (optional) Feature Engineering To improve prediction accuracy, additional features are created such as: Day, month, and year Day of the week Weekend or weekday indicator Lag features (previous sales values) Rolling averages (7-day, 30-day) Seasonal or promotional indicators Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) EDA is performed to: Understand sales trends over time Identify seasonal patterns Detect outliers and missing values Visualize correlations between features Gain insights into factors influencing sales Model Evaluation Models are evaluated using standard performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Mean Squared Error (MSE) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) R² Score A comparative analysis is performed to select the best-performing model. System Architecture React frontend handles user interaction and visualization Python backend exposes REST API endpoints Machine learning model runs on the backend Predictions are returned to the frontend in real time Deployment Strategy Backend can be deployed on: Render Railway PythonAnywhere Frontend can be deployed on: Vercel Netlify The system is scalable and cloud-ready Expected Outcome Accurate and reliable sales forecasting model Performance comparison of multiple ML algorithms Clear visualization of actual vs predicted sales Insights into key factors affecting sales A scalable solution suitable for small businesses Limitations Accuracy depends on the quality of historical data Sudden market changes may not be fully captured Limited external factors such as economy or weather Smaller datasets may reduce prediction reliability Future Enhancements Use deep learning models such as LSTM for forecasting Real-time data integration Automatic model retraining Multi-store sales forecasting Mobile application frontend Integration with POS systems Conclusion This project demonstrates how historical sales data from Kaggle, combined with Python-based Data Science and Machine Learning techniques, can be effectively used to forecast future sales. By using React JS for frontend and Python ONLY for backend (without Node.js), the system remains simple, scalable, and efficient. Accurate sales forecasting enables small businesses to plan inventory better, reduce losses, improve decision-making, and grow sustainably.
